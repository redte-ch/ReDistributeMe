# ReDistributeMe

ReDistributeMe is a RaC-powered webapp built with TypeScript and the OpenFisca
API to show how taxes and social benefits have an impact on households'
disposable income (or their net income including benefits).

Disposable income is a crucial tool for rule-makers to assess fairness and equity.
Its distribution among households varies based on their composition and income
levels. Yet, the complexity of tax and benefit systems makes it challenging to
quickly evaluate constituentsâ€™ disposable income. ReDistributeMe aims to help you
to have a preliminary illustration of disposable income variance, to show how,
based on different household compositions and income levels, it has a
redistributive impact influenced by both taxes and social benefits.
